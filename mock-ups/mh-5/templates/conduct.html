<h1 class="text-center"> Code of Conduct</h1>

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the Mental Hues project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time.
<br>
<br>
Erin Cole, founder and lead developer of the Mental Hues project and contributors to the Mental Hues project are dedicated to a <strong><em>harassment-free experience for everyone</em></strong>, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. <strong>We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form</strong>.
<br>
<br>
We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.
<br>
<br>
The goal of the Mental Hues project is to diminish the stigma associated with mental health disorders. As with many other open source projects, contributors and community members may have current and past symptoms of mental heath disorders. We ask and require everyone who takes part in developing and promoting the Mental Hues project to be sensitive and considerate of each individual's lived experiences and their journey to the Mental Hues project.
