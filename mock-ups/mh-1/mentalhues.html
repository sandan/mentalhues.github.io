           <p class="title"> Learning to Love Again </p>
           <p>
           Love can be a tsunami of emotions. When the tsunami calms back into the rhythmic ebb and flow,
           I find myself looking at the calm sky as I drift in the ocean. Being pulled here and there,
           I can feel the waves taking me on a journey. Where will I end up I wonder? I don't seem to care.
           A flower makes its way into my outstretched hand as I drift.

           <p class="title"> Cocoon of Solitude </p>
           <p>
           I was always the quiet kid in school. I was scared of fitting in. 
           I would rather shut myself off from the world, at least then I
           could spend time with myself and get to know who I am. Who am I? Who do I want to be?
           Finding myself, even at a young age, was so important to me.

           As I grew older, my friends moved away, my parents divorced, and I myself 
           moved away from my cousins and other family members, I became isolated.

           <p>
           I have a friend that I care about dearly. She suffers from many things in her environment
           but one of them is school. I can feel the sense of dread and worry when the quarter starts
           and she has to face her test anxiety again. But the road ahead doesn't have to be filled with dread, 
           there are pit stops we can and should make along the way.
