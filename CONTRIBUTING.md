# Contributing to Mental Hues Repository 
Thanks for finding out how to get involved! We want contributors for all aspects of this project. The most important criteria involves having an interest in the mission of destigmatization of mental health disorders. We need people who want to learn how to understand mental health disorders better and who want to improve misunderstandings.

First and formost, it is crucial that we all stick to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/erindcole/mentalhues/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in order to maintain a caring, collaborative project space. We all are aware of the sensitivity needed to discuss mental health, so let's keep it going :heart:

If you have any questions that have not been addressed here, please ask! You can do so by checking out the [Share Your Thoughts](#share-your-thoughts) section below, or [Get in Touch](#how-to-get-in-touch) with the Core Contributors. This section also provides a direction for checking out Issues that have already been started so you can help answer the questions of others.

Scroll down or jump to one of the following sections:

* [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts)
* [Make a Change](#make-a-change)
* [Get in Touch](#how-to-get-in-touch)

## Share Your Thoughts
Now that you are reading this section, you are a contributer. Welcome to the project! This project needs contributors who can share insights, ask questions, and provide new ideas in the form of comments, adding issues, writing code, and more.

Make sure you are familiar with [discussing changes in issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) before you get started.

We want to communicate our contributions to the community through **issues**. 

### Labels
Labels will help guide you as you decide how you want to contribute. Labels help keep the different types of issues organized. Check out the [current list of labels](https://github.com/erindcole/mentalhues/labels).

## Submit a Hue
Hues are topics related to mental health. Examples of Hues include test anxiety, paranoia, and how to feel understood. We are collecting example stories and hues to help build the website! Currently there are two ways to submit a Hue:

1. Submit the story via Pull Request under the `example-hues` folder. 
2. Email me directly at erincole567@gmail.com and I can submit it on your behalf. I treat all direct contacts via email as confidential.

If you are not famililar with how to open a Pull Request, read the [Make a Change](#make-a-change) section. A pull request that includes a new Hue under the `example-hues/` directory should include the "Hue" label. A core contributor will review the Pull Request.

When the site is built, Hues will be submitted anonymously. To submit a Hue anonymously for now:
- via a Pull Request, attribute the story as "On behalf of Anonymous" or similar in the description or as a comment in the Pull Request.
- via email, just let us know if you would like it to be anonymous (or not).

## Make a Change

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to an issue. A core contributer to the project will follow up with you. Check in with one of the Mental Hues Core Contributors to ensure you aren't overlapping with current developing contributions and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of your contributing idea. You can contact Core Contributors through the [public Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/mentalhues/Lobby).

    [This blog post](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) explains why we want to contribute with Issues.

2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [Mental Hues project repo](https://github.com/erindcole/mentalhues/) to your profile.
   You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.

   Make sure to [keep your fork up to date](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) with the master repository.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

   Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally*    branch out: create [separate branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

   A member of the Core Contributors will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in! You don't have to be    ready to merge to make a pull request! We encourage you to submit a pull request as early as you want to. They help us to keep track of progress and help you to get earlier feedback.

## How to Get in Touch

If you need a more private channel for contact please email me directly: erincole567@gmail.com . I realize that some issues need to be taken offline, and am open to that need. In order to connect with other contributors, we also have a [public Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/mentalhues/Lobby). Because I want to be transparent, I want to mention that the Core Contributors of this project have a private Gitter chat that we use as a safe space to share insights and ideas. We have a concern for laying effective groundwork for this project, and may make this private chat public in the future if we feel that a public chat would be more conducive to working open.
